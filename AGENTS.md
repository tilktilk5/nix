# NixOS Configuration Reference

This file provides a high-level overview of the configuration structure and key features for future reference and AI agents.

## Project Structure Overview

The configuration is split into three main areas: System-wide NixOS settings, User-specific Home Manager settings, and Machine-specific host definitions.

- `flake.nix`: The entry point for the entire configuration. Defines inputs (nixpkgs, home-manager, etc.), orchestrates the `top` NixOS configuration, and exposes a standalone `homeConfigurations.air` for a second, non-NixOS machine.
- `hosts/`: Contains machine-specific configurations.
    - `hosts/top/`: Configuration for the primary host "top" (full NixOS, x86_64-linux).
- **`air`**: a MacBook Air running Fedora Asahi Remix (aarch64-linux), OS hostname `book`. Not NixOS — it only gets `home-manager` layered on top of the existing Fedora install via `homeConfigurations.air` (`home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration` in `flake.nix`, reusing `./lam.nix`/`home/` unchanged). It has no `hosts/air/` or system-level config — `sys/*` is NixOS-only and doesn't apply. Activate/update with `home-manager switch --flake /home/lam/nix#air`.
- `sys/`: System-wide NixOS modules and configurations.
    - Uses a recursive importer in `sys/default.nix` to automatically include all `.nix` files in this tree.
    - `sys/options.nix`: Defines custom options (e.g., `my.aerotheme.enable`).
    - `sys/dsk/`: Desktop environment configurations (Plasma, Hyprland).
- `home/`: Home Manager configuration for the user `lam`.
    - Also uses a recursive importer in `home/default.nix`.
    - `home/pkgs/`: Categories of packages (base, dev, game, media, etc.).
    - `home/prog/`: Program-specific configurations (zsh, bash, mpv, etc.).
- `lam.nix`: The entry point for the Home Manager configuration, which imports the `home/` directory.
- `filer/`: Vendored source of the standalone Qt/QML file browser (its own self-contained flake — `main.py`, `qml/`). Lives at the repo top level **on purpose**: it must stay outside `home/`/`sys/`, whose `umport` recursively imports every `.nix` file (it would try to eval filer's `flake.nix` as a module). Nothing in the NixOS/home evaluation imports `filer/` — it's inert vendored source that simply travels with the repo. The `filer` binary is built and installed by `home/prog/filer.nix`, which wraps `python3` around the **live** source at `/home/lam/nix/filer/main.py` (absolute path, valid on both `top` and `air`), so QML/Python edits are picked up with no rebuild. A compat symlink `~/Projects/filer → ~/nix/filer` preserves the old source path. filer's own flake builds on `x86_64-linux` + `aarch64-linux` (`nix run ~/nix/filer` / `run.sh` work on book too).
- `sounds/`: **git submodule** → `github.com/tilktilk5/vista-sounds` (a PRIVATE repo). Holds the Windows Vista event `.wav`s, which are Microsoft's and must NOT live in this public tree — so they're pulled in privately here. `home/srvs/vista-sounds.nix` exposes the checkout at the runtime path everything expects via an out-of-store symlink (`~/.local/share/sounds/vista → /home/lam/nix/sounds`), so a plain `git pull` picks up new sounds with no rebuild. **Cloning/pulling the config on a new machine (e.g. book) must use `--recurse-submodules`** (`git clone --recurse-submodules …`, or after a plain pull: `git submodule update --init`) or the sounds dir is empty; the private submodule also needs GitHub auth on that machine.

## Key Features & Conventions

### Recursive Imports (`umport`)
Both `sys/` and `home/` use a helper function named `umport` (defined in their respective `default.nix` files). This function automatically imports every `.nix` file found recursively in those directories. Adding a new `.nix` file anywhere in these trees will automatically apply it to the configuration — including for `air`, since it consumes the same `home/` tree as `top` via `lam.nix`.

### Per-host branching (`host`)
`flake.nix` threads `host = "top"` or `host = "air"` into every `home/*.nix` module via `specialArgs`/`extraSpecialArgs` (take it as a module arg: `{ host, ... }:`). Use this — not a separate per-host file — for the rare line that must actually differ (see `home/prog/zsh.nix`'s rebuild aliases, `home/plasma.nix`'s `Xwayland.Scale`, `home/prog/hypr-host.nix`'s generated `host.lua` consumed by `home/prog/hypr-files/hyprland.lua`'s monitor scale). Everything else in `home/` is shared verbatim between both machines — that's the point of the split. Packages unavailable on aarch64-linux (proprietary x86_64-only binaries: `vcv-rack`, `pcsx2`, `vintagestory`, `google-chrome`, `wineWow64Packages`, `spotify`, `dwarf-fortress-packages`) are gated with `lib.optionals pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.isx86_64 [...]` instead of `host ==`, since the real constraint is architecture, not the specific machine.

### Aerotheme Plasma Toggle
The `my.aerotheme.enable` option (defined in `sys/options.nix`) allows for easy switching between a standard Plasma 6 experience and the Windows-themed `aerothemeplasma`.
- **Location:** `hosts/top/configuration.nix` contains the master toggle.
- **Implementation:** `sys/dsk/plasma.nix` handles the conditional session switching and `aeroshell` activation.

### Hardware & Graphics
- `sys/hw/nvidia.nix`: Contains NVIDIA-specific drivers and configuration.
- `sys/gme/steam.nix`: Gaming and Steam-specific system settings.

### Desktop shell: Hyprland + Quickshell (`home/prog/`)

The live desktop is Hyprland driving a Quickshell panel. Source lives in
`home/prog/quickshell-files/` (the `.qml` panel) and `home/prog/hypr-files/`
(`hyprland.lua`), plus the `hyprvtb` Hyprland plugin (`home/prog/hyprvtb/`,
C++ — compositor-side window titlebars + session save/restore).

**Applying edits + reloading (READ THIS before editing panel/hypr config):**

- **Rebuild alias reality:** `rbhome`/`rbsys`/`update` all run
  `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /home/lam/nix/#top` (home-manager is a
  NixOS module here; there is no standalone `home-manager switch`). A NOPASSWD
  rule allows the sudo. A **new** file must be `git add`-ed before the rebuild
  — the tree is dirty and flake eval ignores untracked files, so a brand-new
  `Foo.qml` is silently missing from the build otherwise.

- **Most `quickshell-files/*` are Nix-store symlinks.** A rebuild swaps the
  symlinks but Quickshell watches the resolved store paths, so the swap does
  NOT trigger its hot-reload — the panel keeps running the old tree. Force a
  reload by modifying the ONE real file it watches, `~/.config/quickshell/
  Theme.qml`, **in place (same inode)** — e.g. append then restore a trailing
  comment (`printf '\n// x\n' >> Theme.qml` then `cat backup > Theme.qml`).
  Do NOT use `sed -i`/`mv` (rename = new inode = no reload), and note it
  **dedupes by content** so an identical rewrite is a no-op. A reload rebuilds
  only Quickshell's QML tree in-process (never touches Hyprland); a parse error
  keeps the old tree + fires a toast, so it can't crash the session.

- **Seed-once mutable files are NOT updated by rebuild:** `Theme.qml`,
  `hyprland.lua`, `hyprpaper.conf` are installed only if absent (they're
  rewritten in place at runtime by `wal-set.sh`). To change one, edit BOTH the
  nix source AND the live `~/.config/...` file **in place** (targeted string
  edit — never overwrite wholesale or you reset the live wal palette/border).
  Apply `hyprland.lua` keybind changes with **`hyprctl reload`** (re-runs the
  live Lua, re-registers `hl.bind`s, does not disturb the session). **Trap:** a
  fix applied to the nix `hyprland.lua` source does nothing until it's ALSO put
  in the live file — the running system keeps the old behaviour indefinitely
  (this bit us: a stale `focus workspace 50` line lived on in the live file long
  after it was removed from source, scattering windows across two workspaces).

- **`hyprvtb` plugin (C++) reload after a source edit:** `git add` the changed
  files (flake eval ignores untracked), `rbsys` to recompile (the symlink
  `~/.config/hypr/plugins/libhyprvtb.so` repoints to the new store path), then
  live-reload — but `hyprctl plugin load <the symlink>` does NOT pick up the new
  build: `dlopen` caches by the path string, which never changes, so it returns
  the stale mapping. Load the **resolved** store path instead:
  `real=$(readlink -f ~/.config/hypr/plugins/libhyprvtb.so); hyprctl plugin
  unload "$real"; hyprctl plugin load "$real"`. Bump the version string in
  `main.cpp` per change and confirm `hyprctl plugin list` shows a **new
  Handle + Version** and **exactly one** hyprvtb (unload matches by exact path,
  so a stale prior build can linger as a second copy → double titlebars; unload
  its old store path if so). Reloading is safe (session save/restore) but
  briefly re-decorates every window.

- **`surfer`/`filer` (standalone PySide6 apps) run the LIVE source** at
  `~/nix/{surfer,filer}/main.py` — `.py`/`.qml` edits need NO rebuild, but there
  is NO hot-reload either: **relaunch the app** to pick up a change. Syntax-check
  QML headlessly with `qmllint -I <qml import paths> qml/Main.qml` (import paths
  from the app's wrapper env) — the "Failed to import" lines are just missing
  paths, not errors. QtWebEngine/permission/notification API details are best
  confirmed against the QML type defs (`plugins.qmltypes`) rather than guessed.

- **Verify without visuals — the user does ALL visual/animation/interaction
  checks (screenshots, drags, hover, spinner animation, tooltip look).** Never
  screenshot or drive the GUI yourself unless explicitly asked. Verify by other
  means: `qs log | tail` (panel parse/binding errors — CUMULATIVE across
  reloads, so snapshot the line count first and read only the new tail),
  `qs ipc show`/`qs ipc call` (panel wiring), `hyprctl plugin list`/`clients`/
  `workspaces`/the Hyprland log (plugin state + crashes), `qmllint` (QML syntax),
  and headless PySide harnesses (e.g. pre-grant a permission and assert a signal
  fires) for app logic. Never run bare `qs` (it launches a second panel).

- **Commit + push after making changes here.** `~/nix` is kept committed and
  pushed — after a working change, `git add` the specific files you touched
  (never `-A` when the tree has the user's own uncommitted edits — see the
  maintenance rules below), commit, and `git push origin main` **without waiting
  to be asked**. End commit messages with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Maintenance Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Keep this file updated:** If you make substantial architectural changes, add new top-level directories, or introduce major new features/options, you MUST update this `AGENTS.md` file to reflect those changes.
2. **Respect the Structure:** Follow the existing patterns:
    - System-level changes go into `sys/`.
    - User-level/dotfile changes go into `home/`.
    - Prefer creating small, focused `.nix` files within the appropriate subdirectory instead of bloating `configuration.nix` or `lam.nix`.
3. **Recursive Imports:** Remember that adding a file to `sys/` or `home/` is sufficient for it to be included; you do not need to manually add it to an `imports` list unless it is outside those trees.
4. **Never clobber the user's own edits.** The user routinely hand-edits files in this repo directly (adding a package, flipping an option, etc.) and may leave those changes uncommitted. Before committing or pushing:
    - **Always run `git -C ~/nix status` first.** If the working tree contains changes you did NOT make, STOP. Those are almost certainly the user's — do not assume they are stale or safe to discard.
    - **Never run reverting/destructive git commands** here to "clean up" — no `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore`, `git stash`, or `git clean`. Any of these can silently wipe the user's untracked/uncommitted work, which is exactly the failure to avoid.
    - **Scope your commits to the files you actually changed** (`git add <specific paths>`), rather than `git add -A`, when unexpected changes are present — so you don't bundle the user's in-progress edits into your commit. If you can't tell what's yours vs. theirs, ask before committing.
